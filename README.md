# learningShellScript(?)

Have you ever been in a situation that you have 100 things [toDo](https://github.com/joaobb/learningShellScript/tree/master/toDoProj), but all of a sudden you have an idea of a useless script, and you just give up on everything and spend hours doing it?
So, this is the place I keep some of these mayonnaise's travels.

I hope you have fun :)

bye, have a nice day :D xD
